# Deni-MVC-Tech-Blog-hw14

## Description

My task this week was to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This site was built completely from scratch and deployed to Heroku. This app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Installation

Navigate to the root folder , open an integrated terminal and 'run npm i'. To create the database, access it within the terminal, intitialize the database with 'mysql -u -root -p' then run 'source schema.sql'. Back in the root terminal, seed the database by test running 'npm run seed'. Then start the server with 'npm start' NOTE: make sure to modify the .ENV file with your database password and rename the file to remove the "example" from the file name.
